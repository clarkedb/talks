### Soggetto Cavato: 15th Century Data Encoding

[Neighbor Mind Garden Lecture Series, March 2023](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir9neh_xab2ThykAVNQp9EPLcrUKfFZM):
Talk about the Soggetto Cavato (carved subject) method of embedding words into music from the 15th century. Included a live demonstration of the python project [`soggetto-cavato`](https://github.com/clarkedb/soggetto-cavato) which embeds any string into a simple melody.

### The Halting Problem and Why We Can't Solve All Problems with Code

[Neighbor Mind Garden Lecture Series, December 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir9neh_xab2ThykAVNQp9EPLcrUKfFZM):
An overview of the Halting Problem and the proof by contradiction that shows Turing machines cannot solve it. Explores the consequences and applications in computing.
([Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10sZ-zzw4CGZwyJoVytGc92XkPYbah8qspW1ex88oo9o/edit?usp=sharing) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD8I2F94bBA))

### Testing Ruby Code Using Grift for Mocking Methods

[Neighbor Mind Garden Lecture Series, November 2021](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir9neh_xab2ThykAVNQp9EPLcrUKfFZM):
A walkthrough of using the Ruby gem [`grift`](https://github.com/clarkedb/grift) for mocking methods in the MiniTest testing framework for Ruby. This was given shortly after the inital release of `grift`. ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHtlxiIOYnA))

### Proof of Taylor’s Law for Exponential Growth Models with Migration

[BYU Student Research Conference, February 2020](https://src.byu.edu/):
Talk covering the application of the Perron-Frobenius Theorem regarding an exponential growth model with migration. Covers how that applies to our proof that Talyor's Law holds for the population samples from such a model.

### How Eigenface Facial Recognition Works

[Neighbor Mind Garden Lecture Series, October 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir9neh_xab2ThykAVNQp9EPLcrUKfFZM):
Lightning talk about how eigenface facial recognition works. Explores the role of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in the process.
([Poster](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GF8JN3EVszJGIfjiYegdSBbj31s0x26CZQ3P2Wgsc0o/edit?usp=sharing) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic-RDiKu8dU))

### Edit Distances

[Neighbor Mind Garden Lecture Series, August 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLir9neh_xab2ThykAVNQp9EPLcrUKfFZM):
Talk about edit distance algorithms and some of their use cases in software. Covers some of the common algorithms and the tradeoffs between different distances.

### Modeling Taylor’s Law with Exponential Growth and Migration

[BYU Student Research Conference, February 2020](https://src.byu.edu/):
Talk about then ongoing reserach into Taylor's Law with a population model that incldues exponential growth and migration between sub-populations. Covers Taylor's Law and our approach for proving it holds in a population model with migration.
